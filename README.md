# Spotify Playlist Downloader With Windows GUI

![image](guitool2.png)

Download an entire spotify playlist (160kbps mp3's) to your local machine with a simple interface

When it starts downloading it checks if you already downloaded the song if so it skips it.
When done downloading it also writes the ID3 data and album art to the file.

###To install:
Install nodejs (USE INSTALLER!! Install 64bit if you're on a 64bit system!!!) if you haven't already. ([NodeJS Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))  
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 if you haven't already. ([Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48130))

Then download this repository ([HERE](https://github.com/dekiller82/spotify-playlist-downloader-with-windows-gui/archive/master.zip)) or use the button on github. 

Unpack the repository and run the .exe (source code can be found [here]( https://github.com/dekiller82/Spotify-Playlist-Downloader-GUI))

###First Time Setup (Only needs to be done right after downloading)

**I recommend using a brand new Spotify Account for this tool!**

Log In using your Spotify Username and Password.

You can't login with Facebook accounts so you will have to create a new Spotify user to login.

The tool will check for the node_modules folder on startup. If it's not there it will take care of the npm install.

###Additional Comments

If you get any errors please go to "C:\Program Files\nodejs" and see if node.exe and npm.cmd are installed there

To download Albums for now the only way to do it is to add the songs to a playlist and then download that playlist.

Free Accounts get limited after a while though, but starts downloading again afterwards

You can't login with Facebook accounts so you will have to create a new Spotify user to login.

#####Thanks to /u/dva010/

If you are trying to download an artist that has a '.' at the end of their name, it will create a folder that Windows will not allow you to delete without running a command in cmd.

Pasted command below on how to remove the folder if you guys run into this issue.

Command to delete folder that ends in '.'

rd /s "\?\C:\Documents and Settings\User\Desktop\Annoying Folder."

### Disclaimer:

- This was done purely as an academic exercise.
- This my first coding project so code is sloppy en ugly
- I do not recommend you doing this illegally or against Spotify's terms of service.
